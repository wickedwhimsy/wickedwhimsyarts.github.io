### about me
Hello! Welcome to WickedWhimsyArts. My name is Michael. I'm a Louisiana based artist who likes witchy, fantastical things. My vibe is something between lovecraft, fairies, and unicorns.

I draw inspiration from a variety of sources, (mostly nature, books, games, and travel) to create designs that are both dark, gothic, sometimes colorful, pretty to look at. The designs in this store have a variety of uses, including scrapbooking, card-making, and digital design projects. You are welcome to use them commercially, but please, read the licensing requirements beforehand.

Thank you for stopping by my shop, and I hope you enjoy my designs as much as I enjoy creating them!
